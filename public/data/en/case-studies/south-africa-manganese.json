  "client": "South African Mining Corporation",
  "description": "A high-efficiency manganese ore processing line with annual capacity of 1.5 million tons, designed and commissioned by Zexin Mining Equipment in South Africa's rich manganese deposit region.",
  "challenge": "The project faced several significant challenges. The site location had limited infrastructure and was far from major ports, causing logistics and transportation difficulties. Water resources in the area were scarce, requiring efficient water recycling solutions. Additionally, the client had strict requirements for equipment reliability and product quality while expecting to achieve low operating costs.",
  "solution": "Based on South African manganese ore characteristics, we designed a processing flow including crushing, screening, washing, and classification. We implemented a single-stage crushing, multi-stage screening, and jig concentration process, fully adapted to coarse manganese ore processing requirements, ensuring reasonable product size distribution to meet smelting requirements.\n\nThe main equipment included jaw crushers, vibrating screens, spiral washers, jigs, and filter presses. All equipment was manufactured with high wear-resistant materials to handle the high hardness and abrasiveness of manganese ore, ensuring stable operation of the production line.",
  "results": "The processing plant has been operating stably since commissioning, achieving the designed annual capacity of 1.5 million tons. The manganese concentrate produced meets quality specifications for metallurgical use, with optimized particle size distribution. The water recycling system achieves over 85% water reuse rate, significantly reducing freshwater consumption in the water-scarce area. Equipment reliability has exceeded expectations with minimal downtime, contributing to low operating costs.",
