  "overview": "Zexin Mining's GT Series Trommel Screen represents advanced rotary screening technology, featuring a slow-rotating drum (3-6rpm) with integrated spiral lifting system. This heavy-duty screening solution processes 30-240 m³/h of material through apertures ranging from 10-100mm. Engineered for superior performance in high-moisture conditions, it excels in mining, recycling, and aggregate applications, offering extended service life through wear-resistant design and efficient material separation.",
  "detailedDescription": "The GT Series embodies a distinct engineering philosophy in material separation that leverages rotational dynamics rather than vibrational force. This equipment represents a strategic alternative within the screening technology spectrum, particularly valuable where conventional vibrating screens face inherent limitations. Its significance extends beyond screening performance to operational economics, addressing the total cost of ownership through reduced energy requirements and maintenance complexity. The system's fundamental contribution to mineral processing stems from its ability to transform traditionally problematic materials into processable streams while creating minimal operational disruption.",
