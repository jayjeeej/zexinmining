      "question": "How do I select the correct screen size for my application?",
      "answer": "Selecting the optimal linear vibrating screen involves analyzing several factors: 1) Required throughput capacity (t/h); 2) Feed material characteristics (bulk density, moisture content, shape, stickiness); 3) Desired separation size and precision; 4) Number of fractions needed; 5) Available installation space; and 6) Upstream and downstream process requirements. Our engineering team conducts detailed material testing and process analyses to recommend the ideal screen dimensions, deck configuration, and operating parameters. Generally, we recommend selecting a screen with 20-30% capacity margin above your requirements to accommodate variations in feed conditions and ensure consistent performance."

      "question": "What maintenance is required for linear vibrating screens?",
      "answer": "Proper maintenance ensures optimal performance and longevity. Key maintenance activities include: 1) Daily visual inspections of screen media, structural integrity, and material flow patterns; 2) Weekly checks of vibration motors, bearings, and V-belt condition; 3) Monthly inspection of support springs, vibration isolators, and fasteners; 4) Quarterly lubrication of bearings and mechanical components according to schedule; 5) Bi-annual comprehensive inspection of structural elements, drive components, and electrical systems. Most wear occurs on screen media, which typically requires replacement every 3-12 months depending on material characteristics. We provide detailed maintenance manuals, spare parts packages, and service contracts to maximize equipment availability."

      "question": "How can screen blinding and plugging be prevented?",
      "answer": "We address screen blinding and plugging through multiple approaches: 1) Optimized screen media selection matched to specific material characteristics; 2) Anti-blinding devices including ball trays, vibration boosters, and ultrasonic systems; 3) Specialized screen surface treatments that reduce material adhesion; 4) Properly calibrated vibration parameters (amplitude and frequency) to optimize particle movement; 5) Controlled material bed depth to prevent overloading; 6) Optional spray systems for wet applications to prevent material buildup; 7) Self-cleaning screen designs with specialized wire profiles or aperture shapes; and 8) Correct deck slope angles to maintain proper material flow. For particularly challenging applications, our engineers can develop customized anti-blinding solutions based on specific material testing."

      "question": "What factors affect the screening efficiency of linear vibrating screens?",
      "answer": "Screening efficiency is influenced by several key factors: 1) Feed material properties (particle size distribution, moisture content, shape, density); 2) Vibration parameters (amplitude, frequency, motion pattern); 3) Screen media selection (aperture size, open area percentage, material type); 4) Bed depth on the screen surface; 5) Material feed rate and distribution across the width; 6) Screen inclination angle; 7) Deck configuration and number of decks; 8) Condition of screen media (wear, blinding, tensioning); 9) Ambient conditions (temperature, humidity); and 10) Material residence time on the deck. Our engineers optimize these parameters based on specific application requirements, typically achieving screening efficiencies of 85-95% in properly designed installations."

      "question": "What is the typical lifespan of a linear vibrating screen?",
      "answer": "With proper maintenance and operation, our ZDS/ZKR Series linear vibrating screens have an expected service life of 15-20 years for the main structure and frame components. Vibration motors typically operate for 5-7 years before requiring major overhaul, while screen media life varies from 3 months to 2 years depending on material abrasiveness and operating conditions. Factors affecting equipment longevity include: 1) Material characteristics (especially abrasiveness); 2) Operating hours and throughput; 3) Maintenance practices and frequency; 4) Environmental conditions; and 5) Whether the equipment is operated within its design parameters. We offer comprehensive service packages and preventive maintenance programs to maximize equipment lifespan and protect your investment."

      "question": "How do environmental conditions affect the performance of linear vibrating screens?",
      "answer": "Environmental conditions can significantly impact performance and require specific design considerations: 1) High temperature environments (>40°C) may require special lubricants, enhanced cooling systems, and heat-resistant components; 2) Cold weather operation (<0°C) necessitates low-temperature steel grades, special startup procedures, and freeze protection measures; 3) High humidity areas benefit from corrosion-resistant materials, sealed electrical components, and specialized surface treatments; 4) Corrosive environments (chemical exposure, saltwater proximity) require stainless steel components, specialized coatings, and sealed bearings; 5) High-altitude installations need motor derating and specialized cooling systems. Our engineering team evaluates site-specific conditions during the equipment selection process to ensure optimal performance and durability regardless of environmental challenges."
