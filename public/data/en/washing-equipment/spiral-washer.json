  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How does a single shaft screw washer work?",
      "answer": "Single shaft screw washers operate through the combined action of mechanical agitation and water flow. Material enters the feed end where it encounters a rotating spiral shaft with strategically designed blades. As the screw rotates, it creates turbulent washing action while gradually moving material upward against flowing water. This counter-current process creates particle-to-particle scrubbing that effectively removes surface contaminants like clay and silt. The cleaned material is discharged at the elevated end, while impurities flow out with the water. The precisely engineered screw pitch and rotation speed ensure optimal residence time for thorough cleaning while maintaining material integrity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What advantages does a screw washer offer over other washing equipment?",
      "answer": "Screw washers provide several key advantages: 1) Simple design with fewer moving parts, resulting in higher reliability and lower maintenance; 2) Lower water consumption compared to drum washers; 3) Reduced power requirements while maintaining high throughput rates; 4) Excellent performance with moderately clayey materials in the 0.3-10mm size range; 5) Smaller footprint compared to equivalent capacity washing equipment; 6) Effective dual function of washing and material transport in one unit; 7) Adjustable washing intensity through variable speed control; 8) Lower capital investment and operating costs compared to complex washing systems; 9) Easy operation and maintenance with readily available replacement parts; 10) Versatility across various material types without requiring significant adjustments."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of materials can be processed in FG series screw washers?",
      "answer": "FG series screw washers effectively process a wide range of materials including: 1) Silica sand and industrial minerals requiring high purity; 2) Iron ore and manganese ore with moderate clay contamination; 3) Construction sand and gravel with clay coatings; 4) Limestone and dolomite for construction applications; 5) Non-ferrous metallic ores including copper, lead and zinc; 6) Coal requiring removal of fine impurities; 7) Glass sand requiring quality cleaning; 8) Foundry sand for industrial applications; 9) Feldspar and other industrial minerals; 10) Mineral sands and aggregates. The equipment performs best with materials in the 0.3-10mm size range with low to moderate clay content, typically less than 10% by weight."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I select the appropriate screw washer size for my application?",
      "answer": "Selecting the proper screw washer requires evaluation of several key parameters: 1) Required processing capacity (10-50 t/h for FG series); 2) Material particle size distribution (optimal for 0.3-10mm); 3) Clay or contaminant content percentage in feed material; 4) Required cleanliness level in final product; 5) Available water supply quantity and quality; 6) Material specific gravity and bulk density; 7) Available installation space; 8) Environmental requirements for water management; 9) Budget constraints for capital and operating costs; 10) Process position within the overall flowsheet. Our engineering team provides detailed application assessments to recommend appropriate equipment sizing based on your specific operational needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance procedures are required for screw washers?",
      "answer": "Effective maintenance for screw washers includes: 1) Regular inspection of spiral blades for wear and replacement as needed (typically every 3-6 months depending on material abrasiveness); 2) Monitoring and lubrication of main bearing assemblies according to scheduled intervals; 3) Inspection of drive components including motor, coupling, and reducer; 4) Checking wear liners in high-impact areas and replacing when worn beyond tolerance; 5) Verification of water spray nozzles for proper operation; 6) Inspection of discharge overflow weirs and adjusting as required; 7) Monitoring structural integrity and tightening fasteners as needed; 8) Checking alignment of drive components. With proper maintenance, FG series washers typically achieve service intervals of 3,000-4,000 operating hours between major maintenance activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does water management work with screw washers?",
      "answer": "Water management in screw washers involves several aspects: 1) Fresh water is typically introduced at the discharge end, creating counter-current flow against material direction; 2) Typical consumption ranges from 0.5-1.5 m³ of water per ton of processed material; 3) Contaminated water exits through the overflow weir at the feed end, carrying away clay and silt; 4) Most operations incorporate water recycling systems where process water is treated through settling ponds or mechanical clarifiers and recirculated; 5) Optional water management packages can reduce fresh water makeup requirements to as little as 0.2 m³ per ton while maintaining effective cleaning performance; 6) Water quality monitoring ensures optimal washing efficiency; 7) Flow rates can be adjusted to match specific material contamination levels."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does a screw washer compare to a log washer for clay removal?",
      "answer": "Screw washers and log washers serve similar purposes but have key differences: 1) Screw washers are more effective for materials with low to moderate clay content (up to 10%), while log washers handle higher clay content (up to 20%); 2) Screw washers process smaller material (0.3-10mm) compared to log washers (10-150mm); 3) Screw washers have lower power requirements and water consumption; 4) Log washers provide more aggressive scrubbing through counter-rotating shafts, better for stubborn clay; 5) Screw washers have simpler designs, lower capital costs, and easier maintenance; 6) Log washers offer better retention time control for heavily contaminated materials; 7) Screw washers provide gentler material handling, reducing fines generation; 8) Screw washers typically require less headroom in a plant layout; 9) Log washers generally cost 40-60% more to purchase and operate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What key features should I look for when purchasing a screw washer?",
      "answer": "When evaluating screw washers, consider these critical features: 1) Blade design and material quality - look for wear-resistant alloys with optimized geometry; 2) Main shaft construction - ensure heavy-duty design with adequate bearing support; 3) Drive system reliability - verify use of industrial-grade components; 4) Wear protection in high-impact zones - check for replaceable liners; 5) Adjustable operation parameters - ensure speed control capabilities; 6) Water management features - verify efficient spray systems and overflow controls; 7) Maintenance accessibility - confirm easy access to wear components; 8) Structural integrity - evaluate frame and tank construction quality; 9) Manufacturer support - consider parts availability and technical service; 10) Standardization - favor designs with readily available replacement components."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does energy efficiency in screw washers compare to other washing methods?",
      "answer": "Screw washers offer excellent energy efficiency compared to alternative washing technologies. Power requirements range from 3kW for smaller models to 11kW for larger units, translating to specific energy consumption of approximately 0.2-0.3 kWh per ton of processed material. This represents energy efficiency improvements of up to 40% compared to drum washers and up to 60% compared to log washers with equivalent cleaning effectiveness. Factors contributing to this efficiency include optimized spiral geometry that minimizes resistance, high-efficiency motors meeting IE3 standards, and precision-engineered drive components that minimize power transmission losses. The simple mechanical design with single rotating element significantly reduces energy requirements compared to more complex washing systems."
