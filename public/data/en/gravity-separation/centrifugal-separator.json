    {
      "question": "What is the operating principle of the STLB Series enhanced gravity concentrator?",
      "answer": "The concentrator utilizes enhanced gravitational force through centrifugal action, creating a stable fluidized bed environment. Heavy minerals are captured in the concentration zone while lighter particles are discharged, achieving precise separation based on density differences."
    },
    {
      "question": "What particle size range is optimal for gold recovery?",
      "answer": "The STLB Series effectively processes material from 0.074mm to 5mm, with optimal performance in the 0.074-2mm range. The advanced fluidization system enables recovery rates exceeding 95% for ultra-fine particles down to 0.074mm."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can gold recovery rates be maximized?",
      "answer": "Recovery optimization involves maintaining proper feed density (20-30% solids), ensuring stable feed rate, and adjusting operating parameters including G-force and fluidization water pressure based on ore characteristics."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance schedule is recommended?",
      "answer": "Regular inspections are recommended every 500 operating hours, with comprehensive maintenance at 1000-hour intervals. The rubber-lined internals and stainless steel components extend service life to 8-10 years under normal conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the equipment be integrated into existing processing circuits?",
      "answer": "Yes, the STLB Series features standardized connections and flexible installation options, allowing seamless integration into grinding circuits, gravity circuits, or as a scavenging unit in flotation plants."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the water requirements and management options?",
      "answer": "The STLB60 requires 15-22 m³/h of process water. The advanced water management system includes closed-circuit operation, reducing fresh water consumption by up to 80% through recycling."
    },
    {
      "question": "What advantages does it offer over conventional gravity separation?",
      "answer": "Compared to traditional methods, the STLB Series delivers 40% higher recovery rates, especially for fine particles, while consuming 30% less energy and requiring minimal operator intervention."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the expected service life and durability?",
      "answer": "With proper maintenance, the equipment operates reliably for 8-10 years. Key components use industrial-grade wear-resistant materials, significantly reducing replacement frequency and operating costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can it process multiple mineral types simultaneously?",
      "answer": "Yes, the adjustable operating parameters allow efficient processing of various precious metals and heavy minerals simultaneously, maintaining high recovery rates for each target mineral."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technical support and services are provided?",
      "answer": "We offer comprehensive support including installation supervision, operator training, process optimization, and regular maintenance services to ensure optimal equipment performance throughout its lifecycle."
