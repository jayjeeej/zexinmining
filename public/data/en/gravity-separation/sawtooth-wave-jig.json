    {
      "question": "What makes the Sawtooth Wave Jig different from conventional gravity separators?",
      "answer": "The Sawtooth Wave Jig utilizes a unique sawtooth waveform motion pattern that creates multiple micro-stratification zones within the separation bed. This results in more precise separation of minerals, especially for fine particles and materials with small density differences that conventional gravity separators struggle to process effectively. The specialized motion pattern generates up to 40% higher recovery rates for precious metals compared to traditional equipment, making it ideal for operations where maximizing recovery is critical."

      "answer": "For tin ore processing, our mineral jig separator offers several key advantages: 1) Superior separation efficiency for cassiterite with recovery rates typically 15-25% higher than spiral concentrators; 2) Effective processing of mixed particle sizes (0.1-60mm) in a single unit, eliminating the need for complex classification systems; 3) Ability to handle slimes and clay-rich ores that cause problems in conventional equipment; 4) Lower water consumption and power requirements compared to traditional tin processing methods; and 5) Simple operation and maintenance requirements making it suitable for both established operations and new developments in remote areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "What particle size range is optimal for this high-recovery gravity separator?",
      "answer": "The STWJ-5 high-recovery gravity separator is designed to efficiently process particles from 0.1mm to 60mm, with particularly outstanding performance in the challenging fine particle range (0.1-2mm) where many conventional separation technologies struggle. This wide operating range eliminates the need for extensive pre-classification of feed material, though optimal recovery is achieved when processing narrower size fractions. The equipment's adjustable stroke and frequency parameters allow precise tuning to maximize recovery for specific particle size distributions in your ore."
    },
    {
      "question": "How energy efficient is the Sawtooth Wave Jig compared to other mineral separators?",
      "answer": "The Sawtooth Wave Jig is an exceptionally energy efficient mineral separator, consuming up to 30% less power than conventional jigging equipment and up to 50% less than equivalent capacity spiral or centrifugal concentrators. With power requirements of only 11kW for processing 10-30 tons per hour, it delivers industry-leading energy efficiency of approximately 0.4-1.1 kWh per ton processed. The optimized hydraulic system also reduces water consumption by 20-25%, further enhancing operational efficiency and reducing environmental impact, particularly important for operations in water-scarce regions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the expected return on investment period for the Sawtooth Wave Jig?",
      "answer": "Most operations see a return on investment within 6-12 months when implementing the Sawtooth Wave Jig, primarily through increased recovery rates and reduced operating costs. For gold recovery applications, where recovery increases of 25-40% are common, ROI can be achieved in as little as 3-4 months at current gold prices. The actual ROI period varies based on the specific application, mineral values, and operational parameters, but the combination of improved recovery, lower energy consumption, and reduced water usage consistently delivers compelling economic benefits across all applications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the Sawtooth Wave Jig be integrated into existing mineral processing circuits?",
      "answer": "Yes, the compact design of the STWJ-5 makes it suitable for integration into existing mineral processing circuits. With a footprint of approximately 2.5m x 1.5m, it can be incorporated into most operations without major modifications to existing infrastructure. The system can function as a primary concentrator, scavenger for tailings streams, or cleaner for improving concentrate grades. Our engineering team provides comprehensive integration planning including flowsheet optimization, space utilization, water circuit integration, and control system compatibility to ensure maximum performance improvement with minimal disruption to ongoing operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the maintenance requirement compare to other gravity separation equipment?",
      "answer": "The STWJ-5 features significantly reduced maintenance requirements compared to other gravity separation equipment. The robust construction and simplified drive mechanism minimize wear points, while specialized materials in high-wear areas extend component life by up to 300%. Routine maintenance primarily involves periodic inspection of drive components, checking and adjusting the motion mechanism, and cleaning of the water distribution system, typically requiring only 2-4 hours per month. Most parts are standardized and readily available, minimizing downtime for repairs and ensuring consistent performance throughout the equipment's service life."
    },
    {
      "question": "What technical support is provided with the Sawtooth Wave Jig?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What water quality and infrastructure requirements are needed for optimal operation?",
      "answer": "The Sawtooth Wave Jig is designed to operate effectively with minimal infrastructure requirements, making it suitable for remote locations. Water quality is not critical as the system includes basic filtration components, though extremely muddy water may require supplementary settling or filtration systems. Water consumption ranges from 100-150 cubic meters per hour, with approximately 80-85% recirculation possible in a closed circuit. Power requirements include standard three-phase supply (380-440V) with 11kW capacity. Foundation requirements are minimal, with a level concrete pad of sufficient load-bearing capacity typically adequate for installation."
