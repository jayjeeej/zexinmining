    {
      "question": "What particle size range can the SCDJM-2 Composite Jig Separator effectively process?",
      "answer": "The SCDJM-2 Composite Jig Separator effectively processes materials from 0.5mm to 50mm through its advanced dual-layer separation structure. The upper layer handles coarse particles while the lower layer processes finer fractions, enabling simultaneous multi-size mineral beneficiation.

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the SCDJM-2 Composite Jig Separator achieve efficient gravity separation?",
      "answer": "The SCDJM-2 Composite Jig Separator achieves exceptional gravity separation efficiency through its patented dual-pulse synchronous counter-directional technology. The process creates powerful vertical alternating water currents that penetrate deeply through the mineral bed: when the upper and lower moving parts converge, the water medium generates an upward flow, causing particles to loosen and stratify based on specific gravity; when these parts separate, the rapid downward water movement causes heavy minerals to concentrate on the screen under controlled suction force, completing the hindered settling separation with remarkable precision. This dynamic cycle repeats 60-150 times per minute, creating ideal conditions for density-based particle segregation. Operators can optimize separation performance by adjusting multiple parameters: stroke length controls the intensity of pulsation; frequency determines stratification cycles; water flow affects bed fluidity; and bed depth influences separation precision. The system allows direct observation of stratification quality through strategically positioned viewing windows, enabling real-time process control. The discharge speed can be precisely regulated鈥攕lower discharge produces higher-grade concentrates with exceptional purity (typically 3-5% higher than conventional jigs); faster discharge yields higher throughput and recovery rates, allowing flexible optimization based on specific production requirements and market conditions."
