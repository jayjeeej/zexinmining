  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How does the Spiral Chute achieve efficient separation without using any power?",
      "answer": "The Spiral Chute utilizes natural physical forces - gravity, centrifugal force, and fluid dynamics principles to achieve precise separation. As the pulp flows down the spiral path, centrifugal force pushes material outward while gravity pulls downward. Minerals of different specific gravities form stratification under these two forces, with heavier minerals (such as gold, tin, tungsten) resisting the outward flow and concentrating on the inner side of the spiral, while lighter particles migrate to the outer edge. The specially designed spiral profile further enhances this separation effect, enabling efficient mineral concentration and separation without any power input."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the maintenance requirements and service life of the Spiral Chute?",
      "answer": "The 5LL Series Spiral Chute, constructed with high-strength fiberglass materials and special wear-resistant coating, has extremely low maintenance requirements due to its simple design with no moving parts. Routine maintenance consists only of periodic visual inspection for surface wear, removal of potentially accumulated materials, and adjustment of splitter positions to optimize separation performance. The fiberglass construction offers excellent corrosion and wear resistance, providing up to 5 years of service life under normal operating conditions, significantly reducing maintenance frequency and replacement costs compared to traditional metal separators."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I optimize feed conditions to achieve the best separation results?",
      "answer": "For optimal separation results, feed material should be pre-screened to remove oversized particles (>2mm) and properly classified. The feed pulp concentration should be maintained between 25-35% solids by weight. Feed rate should be controlled within the equipment's designed capacity range, and feed distribution should be even across the spiral width. Regular monitoring and adjustment of splitter positions based on visual observation of separation bands helps maintain optimal separation efficiency. Additionally, maintaining consistent feed characteristics and proper water addition at the feed point are crucial for achieving stable and efficient separation."
