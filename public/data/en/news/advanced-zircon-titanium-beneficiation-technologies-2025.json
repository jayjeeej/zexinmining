  "content": "<p>As important raw materials for modern industry, zircon-titanium minerals are widely used in aerospace, electronics, chemical engineering, and other fields. With growing demand for high-quality zircon-titanium concentrates, efficiently processing low-grade, complex associated zircon-titanium resources has become a significant challenge in the mining technology sector. Facing complex issues in zircon-titanium ore beneficiation such as dissemination grain size differences, similar surface properties, and severe clay contamination, traditional singular beneficiation methods can no longer meet the requirements for high-quality concentrate production. This article systematically explores modern zircon-titanium ore beneficiation processes and optimization strategies, providing comprehensive technical references for the industry.</p><h3>Zircon-Titanium Mineral Characteristics and Separation Challenges</h3><p>Zircon-titanium ore beneficiation technology has evolved from simple hand sorting and gravity separation to modern applications combining multiple separation methods. Early gravity and magnetic separation methods were only suitable for processing simple ores with few associated minerals and uniform zircon-titanium mineral particle sizes.
