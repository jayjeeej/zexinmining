  "content": "<p>As global industrialization continues to accelerate, iron ore resources remain fundamental to economic development. However, with high-grade, easily processable iron ores becoming increasingly scarce, the mining industry must now turn to more complex resources. This article explores technological solutions for processing high-sulfur, high-clay hematite ores, which represent one of the more challenging iron ore types currently being developed to meet growing demand.</p><h3>Mineralogical Characteristics of High-Sulfur, High-Clay Hematite Ores</h3><p>High-sulfur, high-clay hematite ores present unique processing challenges due to their complex mineralogical composition. Extensive analysis by Zexin Mining has identified several key characteristics that impact beneficiation strategies:</p><strong>1. Elemental Composition</strong><p>Typical high-sulfur, high-clay hematite ores contain relatively low iron content, usually around 12-15%, while SiO₂ content can reach 55-60%. Additional elements include significant amounts of Al₂O₃, K₂O, and MgO. This elemental profile significantly complicates the purification process.</p><strong>2. Mineral Composition</strong><p>From a mineralogical perspective, these ores typically contain:</p><p>- <strong>Metallic minerals</strong>: Predominantly hematite with minor amounts of limonite and magnetite, with minimal sulfide mineral content</p><p>- <strong>Gangue minerals</strong>: Primarily quartz, followed by clay minerals such as kaolinite, with minor amounts of mica and chlorite</p><strong>3. Mineral Dissemination Patterns</strong><p>Research conducted by Zexin Mining demonstrates that a defining feature of these ores is the intimate association between hematite and quartz particles. Scanning electron microscopy reveals fine-grained hematite particles intercalated with quartz, while clay minerals occupy interstitial spaces within hematite aggregates. This complex intergrowth pattern represents a key challenge for effective beneficiation.</p><h3>Process Design Principles</h3><p>To address the unique challenges posed by high-sulfur, high-clay hematite ores, Zexin Mining has developed systematic process design principles including:</p><strong>1. Preliminary Desliming</strong><p>Considering the interference caused by both primary clay minerals and secondary slimes produced during crushing and grinding, a preliminary desliming stage effectively mitigates negative impacts on subsequent magnetic separation processes.</p><strong>2. Staged Comminution</strong><p>A refined crushing and grinding system prevents overgrinding, which would further complicate separation. The implementation of classification-rod mill combinations controls grinding fineness to approximately 54% passing 74μm, effectively balancing liberation and overgrinding concerns.</p><strong>3. Multi-stage Separation</strong><p>Based on mineral liberation characteristics at different processing stages, a multi-stage separation flow incorporating high-intensity magnetic separation, regrinding, and reverse flotation progressively enhances concentrate grade and recovery.</p><h3>Innovative Combined Process Technology</h3><p>Zexin Mining has developed an innovative combined process for high-sulfur, high-clay hematite ores that includes the following key components:</p><strong>1. Desliming Technology</strong><p>High-efficiency spiral classifier technology for gravity-based desliming incorporates several technical innovations:</p><p>- <strong>Optimized spiral slope design</strong>: Customized angles based on ore characteristics to maximize separation efficiency</p><p>- <strong>Precise feed density control</strong>: Specialized density control systems maintain optimal separation conditions</p><p>- <strong>Multi-stage classification</strong>: Implementation of multiple classification stages ensures thorough slime removal</p><strong>2. High-Intensity Magnetic Separation Technology</strong><p>For deslimed material, two-stage high-intensity magnetic separation provides effective gangue rejection:</p><p>- <strong>Magnetic field optimization</strong>: Experimental determination of optimal field strength at 278.66kA/m</p><p>- <strong>Multi-stage magnetic separation</strong>: Two-stage process improves iron mineral recovery efficiency</p><p>- <strong>Equipment selection</strong>: High-gradient magnetic separators chosen based on ore characteristics to enhance separation efficiency</p><strong>3. Rougher Concentrate Regrinding Technology</strong><p>Given the intimate intergrowth between hematite and gangue minerals, magnetic separation rougher concentrates undergo regrinding:</p><p>- <strong>Precise grinding fineness control</strong>: Regrinding product controlled to 73.88% passing 45μm to enhance mineral liberation</p><p>- <strong>Appropriate grinding media selection</strong>: Media chosen based on ore hardness characteristics</p><p>- <strong>Classified grinding process</strong>: Prevention of overgrinding while maximizing grinding efficiency</p><strong>4. Reverse Flotation Silica Removal Technology</strong><p>For residual gangue minerals in reground concentrate, reverse flotation technology provides further purification:</p><p>- <strong>Ca²⁺ activation mechanism</strong>: Utilization of calcium ions for selective activation of silica-alumina minerals</p><p>- <strong>Modified starch depression system</strong>: Specialized modified starch as hematite depressant</p><p>- <strong>Mixed amine collection system</strong>: Optimized mixed amine collectors enhance flotation selectivity</p><h3>Industrial Application Results and Economic Analysis</h3><p>Zexin Mining has applied the above process technology to multiple high-sulfur, high-clay hematite projects with significant technical and economic benefits:</p><p><strong>1. Beneficiation Performance Metrics</strong></p><p>Through this combined process, final iron concentrate grades reach 51.28% with iron recovery of 38.74%, meeting industrial production requirements. Compared to traditional single-process methods, concentrate grades improved by 8-10 percentage points, with recovery increasing by 5-8 percentage points.</p><p><strong>2.
