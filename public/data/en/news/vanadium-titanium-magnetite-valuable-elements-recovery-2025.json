  "content": "<p>Vanadium-titanium magnetite, a composite mineral resource rich in strategic metal elements including iron, vanadium, and titanium, has irreplaceable application value in high-end fields such as national defense, aerospace, and advanced materials manufacturing. While China possesses abundant vanadium-titanium magnetite resources, their complex composition presents significant challenges for comprehensive development and utilization, alongside tremendous economic potential. This article systematically explores innovative technological pathways and industrial application progress for efficient separation and enrichment of multiple elements in vanadium-titanium magnetite.</p><h3>Resource Characteristics and Development Challenges of Vanadium-Titanium Magnetite</h3><p>Vanadium-titanium magnetite is a multi-metal co-existing mineral with highly complex composition and structure, characterized by the following aspects:</p><p>- <strong>Elemental Co-existence Complexity</strong>: Iron, titanium, vanadium, and other elements closely co-exist in the mineral, with elements such as titanium, vanadium, and chromium often present in isomorphous form within the titanomagnetite crystal lattice, making complete separation through conventional physical methods difficult</p><p>- <strong>Mineral Dissemination Diversity</strong>: The ore contains unevenly sized magnetite, ilmenite, vanadium-titanium magnetite, and other minerals with complex intergrowth relationships, with a high proportion of fine-grained (<20μm) minerals</p><p>- <strong>Significant Impurity Interference</strong>: Commonly contains harmful impurities such as sulfur, phosphorus, aluminum, and magnesium, which not only affect mineral processing indicators but also constrain the efficiency and product quality of subsequent smelting and processing</p><p>These characteristics determine that vanadium-titanium magnetite cannot be processed using simple, singular mineral processing methods, but requires systematically designed separation processes to achieve staged separation and efficient recovery of multiple elements.</p><h3>Efficient Pre-concentration Technologies for Vanadium-Titanium Magnetite</h3><p>For medium to low-grade vanadium-titanium magnetite, pre-concentration represents the first step toward efficient resource utilization, with the core objective of achieving preliminary separation of valuable minerals from gangue under minimal energy consumption conditions.</p><strong>1. Composite Pre-concentration Processes</strong><p>Traditional singular pre-concentration processes can no longer meet the processing demands of complex ores. Modern pre-concentration technologies are evolving toward diversification and integration:</p><p>- <strong>Dry-Wet Combined High Gradient Magnetic Separation</strong>: For coarse-grained ore, dry magnetic separation first removes large gangue pieces, followed by wet high gradient magnetic separation to recover fine magnetic minerals, forming a staged tailings rejection process that effectively reduces subsequent grinding processing volume by 20-30%</p><p>- <strong>High-Pressure Grinding Rolls and Selective Crushing Combined Process</strong>: Achieving selective mineral liberation through high-pressure grinding rolls, the combined pre-concentration system can achieve 15-20% early gangue rejection at relatively coarse particle sizes (-3mm), while creating favorable conditions for subsequent grinding</p><p>- <strong>Multi-stage Screening and Optical Sorting Combined Technology</strong>: For unevenly disseminated ores, employing staged screening combined with optical identification sorting enables intelligent separation based on ore surface characteristics, significantly improving pre-concentration efficiency</p><strong>2.
