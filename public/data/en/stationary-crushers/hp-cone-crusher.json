    },
    {
      "question": "How do I select the right cavity configuration for my HP Cone Crusher?",
      "answer": "Cavity selection depends on your specific application requirements: 1) Super coarse cavity - primary crushing or feed sizes up to 350mm; 2) Coarse cavity - secondary crushing with feed sizes up to 250mm, for coarse product sizes; 3) Medium cavity - intermediate crushing for medium product sizes (10-25mm); 4) Fine cavity - tertiary crushing for smaller products (6-16mm); 5) Super fine cavity - finishing applications requiring very fine output (5-10mm). Key considerations include: feed material characteristics, desired product size distribution, crushing circuit configuration, and downstream processing requirements. Our application engineers can perform material testing to recommend the optimal cavity configuration."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance schedule is recommended for HP Series Cone Crushers?",
      "answer": "For optimal performance, follow this maintenance schedule: 1) Daily inspections - visual checks of lubrication system, hydraulic pressure, and wear indicators; 2) Weekly maintenance - greasing of external bearings, belt tension checks, and liner wear measurement; 3) Monthly service - comprehensive inspection of all systems, oil and filter analysis; 4) Quarterly maintenance - replacement of filters and scheduled component inspection; 5) Annual overhaul - complete crusher inspection and preventive component replacement. Wear component replacement intervals vary by application, typically 1000-4000 hours for mantle and bowl liners depending on material abrasiveness. The maintenance-friendly design reduces service time by up to 50% compared to conventional crushers."
