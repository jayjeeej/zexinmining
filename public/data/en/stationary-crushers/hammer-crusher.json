      "question": "What types of materials can be processed with the ZPC Series Hammer Crusher?",
      "answer": "The ZPC Series is designed for brittle materials with compression strength below 200MPa and moisture content under 15%. It efficiently processes coal (anthracite, bituminous, lignite), limestone, gypsum, salt, clay, shale, construction waste, and medium-soft minerals. The crusher is not recommended for highly abrasive materials (>15% silica content), extremely hard minerals (>200MPa), or materials with high moisture content (>15%), as these require specialized crushing solutions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the ZPC Hammer Crusher compare to jaw crushers and impact crushers?",
      "answer": "The ZPC Hammer Crusher offers distinct advantages in specific applications: 1) Higher reduction ratio (up to 30:1) compared to jaw crushers (3:1-5:1) and standard impact crushers (10:1-15:1); 2) Better product shape with fewer flaky particles; 3) Lower energy consumption per ton (25% less than comparable impact crushers); 4) Lower capital investment for single-stage crushing; 5) Better performance with moderately moist materials. However, jaw crushers handle harder materials, while impact crushers may process larger feed sizes in certain configurations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance schedule is recommended for the ZPC Series Hammer Crusher?",
      "answer": "Optimal performance requires a structured maintenance program: 1) Daily inspection of hammer wear, belt tension, and material buildup; 2) Weekly greasing of bearings and checking of fasteners; 3) Monthly inspection of wear plates, screens, and rotor balance; 4) Quarterly comprehensive inspection and preventive component replacement. Hammer rotation or replacement interval varies by material: limestone (300-500 hours), coal (500-800 hours), and clay (200-400 hours). The modular design allows complete hammer replacement in under 90 minutes, minimizing downtime in continuous operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I optimize the performance and efficiency of my hammer crusher?",
      "answer": "Performance optimization involves several key practices: 1) Maintain proper feed rate and distribution across the crusher width; 2) Adjust crusher gap settings to match material properties and desired product size; 3) Select appropriate screen configurations for your specific application; 4) Implement a regular hammer rotation schedule to ensure even wear; 5) Monitor motor load to prevent over-crushing; 6) Ensure optimal rotor speed for different materials (higher for harder materials, lower for softer ones); 7) Install proper dust collection systems; 8) Use the crusher's automatic protection systems. These practices can increase productivity by 15-25% while reducing operating costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key factors to consider when selecting the right hammer crusher model?",
