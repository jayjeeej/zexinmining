  "processIntroduction": "The primary objective of placer gold beneficiation is to maximize the recovery of gold and various associated heavy minerals from gangue materials. Zexin implements combined processes involving gravity separation, amalgamation, magnetic separation, and electrostatic separation to achieve optimal results. Our placer gold beneficiation process is particularly suitable for beach placer deposits, riverine placers, and alluvial deposits. The processing typically includes crushing, screening, desliming, and separation operations.",

      "title": "Placer Gold Ore Washing",
      "description": "Many placer gold ores contain clay agglomerates, some exceeding 100mm in diameter. If these agglomerates are not properly disintegrated, they can be discharged with waste rock during screening, resulting in gold losses. Zexin employs specialized washing equipment to effectively break down these clay-bound aggregates, ensuring maximum gold liberation before subsequent processing. Vibrating screens and trommel screens are commonly used as screening equipment due to their long service life and high processing capacity."

      "title": "Placer Gold Separation",
      "description": "Practical experience has proven that gravity separation is the most effective and economical method for processing placer gold ore. Due to the varying particle size distribution of gold in different placer deposits and the different effective size limits of various processing equipment, Zexin implements a rational placer gold separation process that combines several gravity separation devices working in sequence. This integrated approach ensures optimal recovery across the entire particle size range present in the ore."

      "title": "Jigging and Shaking Table Gravity Separation",
      "description": "Zexin's jigging machines feature conical slide valves that reduce failure rates by 80% and consume less energy while meeting the separation requirements of different materials, increasing processing capacity by over 35%. Additionally, Zexin jigs incorporate advanced variable frequency drive technology for ease of operation and management, with a smaller footprint and higher processing capacity per unit area. Zexin has also improved traditional 6S shaking tables by adopting a cam-lever head design, allowing stroke adjustment by changing the position of the sliding head on the rocker arm, while frequency is adjusted through the smooth motor pulley. These innovations result in easier stroke adjustment, smoother table operation, compact structure, and lower energy consumption."

      "title": "Process Advantages",
      "description": "Zexin's placer gold beneficiation process features a simple flowsheet with low equipment costs and ease of operation. Moreover, the process is environmentally friendly, allowing direct discharge of tailings, which significantly reduces the civil construction investment for the entire processing plant. The modular design of our equipment enables rapid deployment and flexibility to accommodate seasonal operations or varying deposit characteristics, making it ideal for both small-scale and large-scale placer gold operations."
