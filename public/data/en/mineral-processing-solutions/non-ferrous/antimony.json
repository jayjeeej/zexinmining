  "processTitle": "Antimony Ore Beneficiation Process Flow",
  "processIntroduction": "Antimony ore has a specific gravity (4.5-5.4) significantly higher than associated gangue minerals (2.5-2.8), making gravity separation highly efficient. This method offers advantages of high efficiency, energy conservation, and environmental protection, while enabling pre-concentration of low-grade ores. The gravity-separated antimony concentrates are then further purified through flotation. Therefore, Zexin typically employs a combined gravity-flotation process for antimony ore beneficiation, achieving optimal recovery rates and concentrate grades.",
  "processSteps": [
    {
      "title": "Pre-selection Preparation",
      "description": "The raw antimony ore undergoes multi-stage crushing to reduce particle size below 30mm. The crushed material is then classified into three size fractions: 8-30mm, 2-8mm, and 0-2mm through high-efficiency vibrating screens. This critical preparation step maximizes the efficiency of subsequent gravity separation processes while minimizing overgrinding, establishing optimal conditions for maximum recovery and grade throughout the beneficiation process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gravity Separation",
      "description": "The three size fractions are directed to Zexin's specialized jigging equipment: large box-type jigs for coarse material, medium-sized jigs for intermediate sizes, and oscillating table jigs for finer fractions. This stage leverages the significant density differential between antimony minerals (SG 4.5-5.4) and gangue (SG 2.5-2.8), efficiently producing a pre-concentrated product that advances to the gravity concentrate collection area. The process achieves 60-75% waste rejection while maintaining 85-95% antimony recovery."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flotation Enhancement",
      "description": "Following gravity separation, tailings undergo precision grinding (80% passing -74Î¼m), classification, reagent conditioning, and selective flotation. The circuit employs a one-rougher, three-cleaner, two-scavenger configuration to produce high-grade (55-65% Sb) antimony concentrate powder. Flotation tailings are further processed through shaking tables to recover fine oxidized antimony particles, achieving overall flotation recovery rates of 92-97%. This integrated approach effectively processes both sulfide and oxide antimony minerals with outstanding metallurgical performance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Manual Sorting",
      "description": "For coarse, high-grade antimony-bearing material, Zexin incorporates a strategic manual sorting stage within the crushing circuit. Experienced operators visually identify and hand-select high-grade antimony chunks, which are separated for direct processing. The remaining material re-enters the gravity separation circuit. This supplementary step significantly enhances both the final concentrate grade and overall recovery efficiency, particularly effective for ores with visible high-grade components."

      "description": "The high-efficiency pre-concentration capabilities of our process transform marginal antimony deposits (<1% Sb) into economically viable resources. By rejecting 65-80% of the mass as waste rock early in the process while recovering >85% of antimony values, operations can drastically reduce processing costs per ton of final concentrate. This approach has successfully revitalized numerous deposits previously classified as sub-economic, expanding global antimony reserves while minimizing environmental footprint."
