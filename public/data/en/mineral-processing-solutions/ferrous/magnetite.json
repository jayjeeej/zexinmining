  "processTitle": "Magnetite Ore Beneficiation Process Flow",
  "processIntroduction": "Magnetite ore beneficiation methods dominate iron ore separation processes. Zexin employs gravity separation, magnetic separation, flotation, and roasting-magnetic separation, as well as combined processes for treating weakly magnetic lean iron ores. For strongly magnetic iron ores, direct magnetic separation methods are applied. Our tailored approach ensures optimal recovery and grade for various magnetite ore types.",

      "title": "Process Selection",
      "description": "Zexin selects appropriate beneficiation methods based on the magnetic strength of the ore. Magnetic separation serves as the primary process method, complemented by gravity separation, flotation, and roasting-magnetic separation combined into integrated process flows. This methodical approach ensures systematic mineral separation with clear technical foundations, establishing optimal conditions for maximum recovery throughout the beneficiation process."

    {
      "title": "Strong Magnetic Iron Ore Processing",
      "description": "This method is primarily used to beneficiate low-grade magnetite ores. Due to the strong magnetic properties and favorable grinding and separation characteristics, coarse-grained magnetite typically undergoes single-stage grinding, while finer-grained ores require multi-stage grinding processes. Zexin's advanced magnetic separation equipment efficiently separates magnetite from gangue materials, achieving high recovery rates while maintaining optimal concentrate grades."
    },
    {
      "title": "Weak Magnetic Iron Ore Processing",
      "description": "Weakly magnetic minerals undergo magnetic roasting treatment to enhance their magnetic properties, after which they can be beneficiated using methods suitable for strongly magnetic minerals. Zexin's specialized magnetic roasting technology transforms weakly magnetic iron minerals into strongly magnetic forms through controlled temperature and atmosphere conditions. This conversion enables efficient magnetic separation in subsequent processing stages, significantly improving recovery rates for these traditionally challenging ore types."

    {
      "title": "Fine Grinding Technology",
      "description": "In the two-stage grinding, stage-wise separation, and single weak magnetic separation process, Zexin incorporates fine screening with regrinding and re-separation of oversize material. This advanced approach ensures timely separation of fine-grained minerals that have achieved liberation, reducing over-grinding phenomena and increasing processing capacity. The fine grinding technology can improve concentrate grades by approximately 2%, elevating typical concentrates from 61% to around 67% iron content."
