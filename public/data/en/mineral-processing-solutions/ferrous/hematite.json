  "processIntroduction": "Zexin's hematite ore beneficiation process employs staged grinding and staged separation for high efficiency, combined with multiple integrated technologies for environmentally friendly processing. The strong magnetic separation tailing-reverse flotation process ensures high-grade concentrate production. This comprehensive approach delivers optimal recovery and concentrate grades for various hematite ore types, particularly those with complex mineralogical characteristics.",
  "processSteps": [
    {
      "title": "Jigging Process",
      "description": "Prior to grinding, the crushed hematite ore undergoes jigging to pre-concentrate the coarse particles. This crucial pre-concentration step effectively separates the higher-density hematite minerals from lighter gangue materials based on differences in settling behavior under pulsating water flows. The jigging process enables early recovery of coarse-liberated hematite particles, reducing the load on subsequent grinding circuits while improving overall process efficiency and recovery rates."

    {
      "title": "First-Stage Grinding and Classification",
      "description": "The first stage grinding and classification employs ball mills and cyclones in a closed-circuit configuration, ensuring both classification efficiency and precise particle size control. This stage allows for early separation of qualified concentrate, reducing subsequent processing volumes and lowering operational costs. Through high-gradient magnetic separators, low-grade tailings are rejected early, which both reduces regrinding volume and prevents over-grinding, minimizing metal losses in the process."

    {
      "title": "Magnetic-Flotation Combined Process",
      "description": "Zexin's integrated magnetic-flotation technology promptly separates qualified coarse-grained concentrate and tailings, adhering to the principle of early recovery and early rejection. This environmentally friendly approach significantly reduces flotation processing volume and lowers operational costs. The magnetic separation efficiently recovers ferrous minerals while preparing optimal feed material for the subsequent flotation stages, ensuring maximum process efficiency and mineral recovery."

      "title": "Strong Magnetic Tailings Rejection",
      "description": "The strong magnetic process effectively recovers fine-grained iron minerals while performing dual functions of desliming and tailings rejection, creating favorable conditions for flotation operations. This specialized stage utilizes precision-engineered magnetic field gradients to capture weakly magnetic hematite particles that might otherwise be lost to tailings. The process significantly improves overall iron recovery while enhancing the quality of material reporting to flotation."

    {
      "title": "Reverse Flotation Process",
      "description": "The reverse flotation process employs a simplified reagent system that significantly reduces the introduction of organic chemicals into the pulp, minimizing their adverse effects on the flotation process. This 'float few, depress many' approach is particularly effective for hematite beneficiation, as it focuses on floating the minority gangue minerals while keeping the valuable iron minerals in the pulp. The result is a high-grade iron concentrate with minimal impurities, meeting stringent quality specifications for downstream applications."
