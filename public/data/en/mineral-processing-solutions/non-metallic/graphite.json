  "processIntroduction": "Crystalline graphite possesses natural floatability, making flotation the primary method Zexin employs for graphite ore processing. Flake graphite demonstrates excellent flotation properties, allowing for effective separation through flotation techniques. For graphite ores containing multiple gangue minerals, Zexin implements combined gravity separation and flotation processes to achieve optimal results. Our graphite beneficiation process is particularly suitable for different crystalline forms of graphite ore, including those associated with mica, silicate minerals, or pyrite.",

      "title": "Multi-Stage Grinding and Flotation",
      "description": "To preserve the integrity of graphite flakes, which directly affects concentrate value, Zexin typically implements a multi-stage grinding and flotation process. This approach involves carefully controlled grinding followed by flotation, with subsequent regrinding and reflotation of intermediate products. This progressive liberation strategy minimizes overgrinding of graphite flakes while effectively separating them from gangue minerals. The multi-stage process ensures optimal flake preservation while achieving high-grade concentrates that meet stringent market specifications."

      "title": "Combined Gravity Separation and Flotation",
      "description": "For graphite ores associated with heavy minerals, Zexin employs an integrated approach combining gravity separation and flotation. The process begins with gravity separation to remove heavy minerals, followed by flotation of the gravity tailings containing graphite and lighter gangue minerals. This sequential methodology maximizes graphite recovery while effectively managing complex mineral associations. The combined process is particularly effective for graphite ores containing sulfides or other dense minerals that could interfere with direct flotation performance."

      "title": "Specialized Equipment Selection",
      "description": "Zexin's graphite beneficiation processes utilize carefully selected equipment optimized for each processing stage. Primary crushing typically employs jaw crushers, while secondary and tertiary crushing may utilize cone crushers or hammer mills depending on ore characteristics. Grinding operations primarily use wet ball mills or grid-type ball mills that minimize graphite flake damage. Flotation typically employs specialized JJF, XCF, or XJB-type flotation cells designed for graphite processing. Dewatering systems incorporate hydrocyclones or belt filters optimized for graphite concentrate handling."

      "title": "Customized Reagent Regimes",
      "description": "Zexin's graphite beneficiation processes employ carefully formulated reagent regimes tailored to specific ore characteristics. In multi-stage flotation operations, common frothers include various oils (No.2 oil, No.4 oil), ether alcohols, and butyl ethers. Collectors typically include kerosene, diesel oil, heavy oil, sulfonic acid esters, sulfates, phenols, and carboxylic acids. The precise reagent combinations and dosages are determined through detailed mineralogical analysis and bench-scale testing, ensuring optimal selectivity, recovery, and concentrate quality for each unique graphite deposit."
