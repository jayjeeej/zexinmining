  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a high weir spiral classifier and a submerged spiral classifier?",
      "answer": "High weir spiral classifiers have the spiral partially exposed above the slurry level with a higher overflow weir, creating a coarser separation point. This design is ideal for applications requiring relatively coarser particle separation (typically >0.15mm). In contrast, submerged spiral classifiers have the spiral completely immersed in the slurry, achieving finer separation points and are better suited for fine material classification. High weir models typically operate at higher spiral speeds and provide better dewatering of coarse material."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I select the right size of high weir spiral classifier for my operation?",
      "answer": "Selecting the appropriate classifier size depends on several factors: required processing capacity (tons per day), desired particle size separation point, feed material characteristics (size distribution and density), and space constraints. Key specifications to consider include spiral diameter, spiral speed options, tank length, and motor power. Our engineering team can help determine the optimal model based on your specific processing requirements, material analysis, and operational parameters."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance is required for high weir spiral classifiers?",
      "answer": "Regular maintenance includes inspection of spiral blades for wear and damage, lubrication of bearings and drive components, checking for proper spiral alignment, inspection of the lifting mechanism, monitoring motor performance, and cleaning of the tank to prevent sediment build-up. Maintenance frequency depends on operating conditions, with more abrasive materials requiring more frequent inspections. We recommend a comprehensive inspection every 3-6 months for optimal performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can high weir spiral classifiers handle different types of minerals?",
      "answer": "Yes, our high weir spiral classifiers are designed to process a wide range of minerals and materials with different densities and hardness characteristics. They effectively handle metallic ores (gold, copper, iron), non-metallic minerals, coal, sand and gravel, and various industrial minerals. The adjustable spiral speed and weir height allow for customization to specific material properties, ensuring optimal classification results across different applications."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the advantages of double spiral classifiers over single spiral models?",
      "answer": "Double spiral classifiers offer several advantages: nearly doubled processing capacity within a similar footprint, improved efficiency for high-throughput operations, better handling of fluctuating feed rates, reduced capital cost per ton of processed material, and operational redundancy (if one spiral requires maintenance, the unit can often continue operating at reduced capacity). However, they require more powerful motors and have a higher initial capital cost compared to single spiral models."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does spiral speed affect classification performance?",
      "answer": "Spiral speed is a critical operational parameter that directly impacts classification efficiency. Higher speeds (8-22 r.p.m) generally result in coarser separation points and are suitable for materials with larger particle sizes. Lower speeds (2.4-8 r.p.m) provide finer separation points and better precision for materials with smaller particle sizes. The optimal speed depends on feed characteristics, desired cut point, and processing objectives. Our classifiers offer multiple speed options to accommodate various operational requirements."
