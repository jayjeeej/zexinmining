      "question": "What factors determine hydrocyclone separation efficiency?",
      "answer": "Hydrocyclone separation efficiency is influenced by several key factors: feed pressure, feed concentration, particle size distribution, feed flow rate, cyclone geometry (body diameter, cone angle, vortex finder diameter), and material characteristics. Optimal performance requires careful consideration and adjustment of these parameters based on specific application requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I select the right hydrocyclone size for my operation?",
      "answer": "Selection depends on several factors: required processing capacity (m³/h), desired cut point, feed material characteristics, operating pressure requirements, and space constraints. Key specifications include body diameter, cone angle, and pressure range. Our engineering team can help determine the optimal model based on your specific processing requirements and material analysis."

    {
      "question": "What maintenance is required for mining hydrocyclones?",
      "answer": "Regular maintenance includes inspection of wear parts (especially the vortex finder, spigot, and cone section), monitoring of operating pressure and flow rates, checking for unusual vibration or noise, and cleaning of feed ports to prevent blockage. Maintenance frequency depends on material abrasiveness and operating conditions, with inspections typically recommended every 2-4 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can hydrocyclones handle different types of minerals?",
      "answer": "Yes, our hydrocyclones are designed to process various minerals with different densities and hardness characteristics. They effectively handle metallic ores (gold, copper, iron), non-metallic minerals, and industrial minerals. The adjustable operating parameters allow customization for specific material properties."

    {
      "question": "What are the advantages of polyurethane-lined hydrocyclones?",
      "answer": "Polyurethane-lined hydrocyclones offer several benefits: excellent wear resistance, extended service life, reduced maintenance costs, consistent performance over time, smooth surface finish for improved flow characteristics, and resistance to corrosion and chemical attack. They are particularly suitable for abrasive applications."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does feed pressure affect classification performance?",
      "answer": "Feed pressure directly impacts classification efficiency. Higher pressures (0.2-0.4 MPa) generally result in finer separation points and higher capacity but increased wear. Lower pressures (0.03-0.2 MPa) provide coarser separation points and are suitable for larger particle sizes. The optimal pressure depends on desired cut point and material characteristics."
