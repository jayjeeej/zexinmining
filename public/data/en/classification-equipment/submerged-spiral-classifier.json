    {
      "question": "What is a submerged spiral classifier and how does it work?",
      "answer": "A submerged spiral classifier is a mineral processing equipment that separates particles based on size and density. It features a mechanically driven spiral that rotates within a slurry tank. As the spiral rotates, heavier/coarser particles settle to the bottom and are transported upward by the spiral against the water flow, while finer particles remain suspended and flow out with the overflow water. The submerged design means the spiral is completely immersed in the slurry, providing optimal separation efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between single spiral and double spiral classifiers?",
      "answer": "Single spiral classifiers have one spiral shaft within the tank and are suitable for operations with moderate capacity requirements. Double spiral classifiers feature two parallel spiral shafts within a wider tank, effectively doubling the processing capacity while maintaining similar separation efficiency. Double spiral models are ideal for higher throughput operations and offer better space efficiency per ton of processed material."
    },
    {
      "question": "What factors affect the classification efficiency of a spiral classifier?",
      "answer": "Several factors influence classification efficiency: spiral speed (slower speeds typically improve precision), spiral immersion depth, tank slope angle, feed material characteristics (size distribution and density), slurry density, feed rate, and overflow weir height. Proper adjustment of these parameters based on specific ore properties is essential for achieving optimal classification results."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance is required for spiral classifiers?",
      "answer": "Regular maintenance includes inspection of spiral blades for wear and damage, lubrication of bearings and transmission components, checking for proper spiral alignment, inspection of the lifting mechanism, monitoring motor performance, and cleaning of the tank to prevent build-up. The maintenance frequency depends on operating conditions, with more abrasive materials requiring more frequent inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does a submerged spiral classifier compare to a high weir classifier?",
      "answer": "Submerged spiral classifiers have the spiral completely immersed in the slurry, creating a finer separation point and are ideal for finer material classification. High weir classifiers have part of the spiral above the slurry level, creating a higher overflow point that allows for coarser particle separation. Submerged models typically achieve more precise classification of fine materials, while high weir models handle coarser separations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the typical lifespan of a spiral classifier?",
      "answer": "With proper maintenance, a quality spiral classifier can operate for 15-20 years or more. The actual lifespan depends on operating conditions, material abrasiveness, maintenance practices, and operating hours. Components like spiral blades and bearings may require replacement several times throughout the equipment's life, but the main structure and tank can last for decades when properly maintained."
