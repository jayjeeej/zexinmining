  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What factors determine the separation efficiency of a cone classifier?",
      "answer": "Cone classifier separation efficiency is influenced by several key factors: feed particle size distribution, feed solids concentration, settling area, residence time, feed flow rate, classifier geometry (diameter, cone angle), and material characteristics. These parameters need to be carefully considered and adjusted according to specific application requirements to achieve optimal performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I select the appropriate cone classifier size for my operation?",
      "answer": "Selection depends on multiple factors: required processing capacity (t/h), target cut point, feed material characteristics, settling area requirements, and space constraints. Key specifications include the classifier diameter, settling area, and volume. Our engineering team can help determine the optimal model based on your specific processing needs and material analysis."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance does a cone classifier require?",
      "answer": "Regular maintenance includes inspecting wear components (especially discharge pipes and valves), monitoring discharge concentration and flow rates, checking for abnormal buildup or blockages, and cleaning feed distribution systems to prevent plugging. Maintenance frequency depends on material abrasiveness and operating conditions, with inspections typically recommended every 2-4 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can cone classifiers handle different types of minerals?",
      "answer": "Yes, our cone classifiers are designed to process various minerals with different density and hardness characteristics. They effectively handle metallic ores (gold, copper, iron), non-metallic minerals, and industrial minerals. The adjustable operating parameters allow customization according to specific material properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does a cone classifier differ from a hydrocyclone?",
      "answer": "While both separate particles based on settling principles, cone classifiers operate at lower velocities and pressures than hydrocyclones, making them suitable for more fragile materials and coarser separations. Cone classifiers typically have larger residence times, more consistent underflow densities, and are less prone to wear, while hydrocyclones offer higher throughput rates and finer separation points."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does discharge concentration affect classification performance?",
      "answer": "Discharge concentration directly impacts classification efficiency. Higher concentrations (50-60%) typically result in sharper separations but may increase the risk of coarse particles reporting to overflow. Lower concentrations (40-50%) provide more dilute underflow with potentially higher recovery of fines but may compromise separation sharpness. Optimal concentration depends on the desired cut point and material characteristics."
