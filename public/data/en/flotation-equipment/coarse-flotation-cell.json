  "overview": "The Coarse Flotation Cell is a high-efficiency flotation equipment specially designed for processing coarse and heavy mineral particles. It adopts a dual-tank structure (suction tank and direct flow tank) to effectively process mineral particles with larger size and higher specific gravity. Its specially designed impeller structure generates powerful stirring force and reasonable flow field distribution, improving the flotation efficiency of coarse-grained minerals, widely used in the beneficiation processes of non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, and precious metals.",
  "detailedDescription": "The CLF Series Coarse Flotation Cell is Zexin Mining Equipment's professional solution to the challenges of processing coarse and heavy mineral particles, with its innovative dual-tank structure revolutionizing the limitations of traditional flotation machines in recovering large-diameter minerals. Its powerful stirring system combined with optimized flow field distribution not only prevents coarse and heavy mineral particles from settling but also significantly increases mineral-bubble contact probability and attachment efficiency. This equipment demonstrates excellent adaptability under various complex ore conditions, especially when processing minerals larger than 0.2mm, where recovery rates are 20-30% higher than traditional equipment, making it an ideal choice for coarse-grained mineral flotation and creating favorable conditions for concentrator plants to increase capacity and reduce costs.",

    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a Coarse Flotation Cell and a conventional flotation machine?",
      "answer": "The Coarse Flotation Cell uses a dual-tank structure (suction tank and direct flow tank) and specially designed impeller system, while conventional flotation machines typically have a single-tank design. Coarse Flotation Cells have greater stirring intensity, allowing them to effectively suspend mineral particles with higher specific gravity and larger particle size; their flow field distribution is more rational, preventing coarse heavy particles from settling; and they have stronger bubble-mineral contact capability, significantly improving recovery rates of large-diameter minerals (0.2-0.5mm) by 20-30% compared to conventional flotation machines."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the maximum particle size that a Coarse Flotation Cell can process?",
      "answer": "Coarse Flotation Cells are designed to process larger-sized mineral particles, generally capable of effectively processing particles up to 0.5mm in diameter, and in some mineral types and specific conditions, even particles up to 0.8mm. Processing capability is closely related to the mineral's specific gravity, shape, surface properties, and beneficiation reagent scheme. For minerals with specific gravity in the range of 2.5-7.0, CLF Series Coarse Flotation Cells can provide excellent flotation effects."
    },
    {
      "question": "In which mineral applications does the Coarse Flotation Cell perform best?",
      "answer": "Coarse Flotation Cells perform particularly well in the following mineral applications: roughing operations of sulfide copper-lead-zinc ores; flotation separation of ferrous metals such as magnetite and hematite; recovery of native gold and coarse-grained gold-silver ores; separation of coarse-grained graphite, barite, and other industrial minerals; and recovery of coarse-grained valuable minerals from various tailings. Especially when processing coarse particles that traditional flotation machines struggle to recover effectively, CLF Series Coarse Flotation Cells demonstrate clear technical advantages and economic benefits."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I select the appropriate Coarse Flotation Cell model?",
      "answer": "Selecting the appropriate Coarse Flotation Cell model requires consideration of the following factors: the processing capacity requirements of the concentrator plant; the particle size distribution and specific gravity of the ore; properties of the target minerals; feed concentration; separation recovery requirements; and process flow design and plant space limitations. CLF Series Coarse Flotation Cells are available in multiple specifications, ranging from 2 cubic meters to 40 cubic meters, and suitable unit volumes and tank types (suction tank or direct flow tank) can be selected according to actual needs. Laboratory or pilot-scale flotation tests are recommended before finalizing the selection to obtain optimal process parameters and equipment configuration."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key maintenance points for a Coarse Flotation Cell?",
      "answer": "Key maintenance points for Coarse Flotation Cells include: regularly checking the wear condition of impellers and stators (which may be more severe than conventional flotation machines due to processing coarse particles); inspecting and adjusting the height relationship between the impeller and slurry level; lubricating main shaft bearings and transmission components; checking motor performance and connections; cleaning accumulated deposits in the tank; and ensuring the air system is unobstructed. It is recommended to establish a regular maintenance schedule based on the abrasiveness of the processed minerals, typically conducting a comprehensive inspection and necessary repairs every 1-2 months when processing highly abrasive minerals."
