  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How does a pneumatic flotation cell work?",
      "answer": "Pneumatic flotation cells operate by injecting compressed air through a specially designed impeller-stator system into mineral slurry. The impeller disperses the air into fine bubbles while providing sufficient agitation. Hydrophobic mineral particles attach to these bubbles and rise to form a mineral-rich froth layer at the surface, which is then collected by scrapers, while hydrophilic gangue remains in the slurry."
    },
    {
      "question": "What advantages do pneumatic flotation cells offer?",
      "answer": "Pneumatic flotation cells provide several advantages: finer and more uniform bubble generation improving mineral recovery; better control of air distribution; lower energy consumption; higher processing capacity per unit volume; improved selectivity; and more consistent performance across varying ore types. These benefits typically result in 10-15% higher recovery rates and 20-30% lower operating costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which minerals can be processed?",
      "answer": "Pneumatic flotation cells are versatile and can process a wide range of minerals including sulfide ores (copper, lead, zinc, nickel), precious metal ores (gold, silver), industrial minerals (graphite, feldspar, fluorite), coal, and phosphates. With proper reagent regimes, they can effectively separate almost any mineral that responds to froth flotation principles."
    },
    {
      "question": "What maintenance is required?",
      "answer": "Regular maintenance includes inspection of impellers and stators for wear (typically every 3-6 months); checking and servicing of air distribution systems; maintenance of motors and drive components; inspection of seals and bearings; cleaning of froth removal mechanisms; and periodic calibration of air flow controllers. Preventative maintenance schedules should be established based on ore abrasiveness and operational hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I determine the right flotation cell size for my operation?",
      "answer": "Selecting the appropriate flotation cell size depends on several factors: required processing capacity, residence time needed for adequate mineral recovery, feed characteristics (particle size, mineral composition), circuit configuration (number of cleaning stages), and space constraints. Laboratory and pilot plant testing is strongly recommended before final size decisions to determine optimal flotation parameters."
