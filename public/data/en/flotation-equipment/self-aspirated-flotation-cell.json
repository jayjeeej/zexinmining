  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How does a self-aspirated flotation cell work?",
      "answer": "Self-aspirated flotation cells operate through specially designed impellers and self-aspiration systems. When the impeller rotates at high speed, it creates a negative pressure area around the impeller, automatically drawing in air through the air intake pipe. This air is dispersed by the impeller into fine bubbles and uniformly distributed throughout the slurry. Hydrophobic mineral particles attach to the bubbles and rise to form a mineralized froth layer at the surface, which is collected by scrapers, while hydrophilic gangue particles remain in the slurry."
    },
    {
      "question": "What advantages do self-aspirated flotation cells offer compared to traditional flotation equipment?",
      "answer": "The main advantages of self-aspirated flotation cells include: no need for external blowers, reducing investment and energy consumption; finer and more uniform bubbles, improving mineral recovery; simplified equipment structure, lowering maintenance costs; automatic air volume regulation, strong adaptability; smaller footprint, easier installation; lower energy consumption, reducing operating costs by 20-30%; more stable flotation indices, more consistent product quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of minerals can be processed using self-aspirated flotation cells?",
      "answer": "Self-aspirated flotation cells are suitable for processing a wide range of minerals, including sulfide ores (copper, lead, zinc, nickel), oxide ores (after sulfidation treatment), precious metal ores (gold, silver), ferrous metals (iron, manganese), non-metallic minerals (graphite, fluorite, feldspar), and coal. Any mineral suitable for flotation processes can achieve good separation results in self-aspirated flotation cells when paired with appropriate flotation reagents."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I select the right self-aspirated flotation cell model for my needs?",
      "answer": "Selecting the appropriate self-aspirated flotation cell model requires consideration of several factors: processing capacity requirements, ore characteristics (particle size distribution, mineral composition), target recovery rate and grade, budget constraints, space availability, and existing flotation circuits. Laboratory testing and pilot trials are recommended before final selection to determine optimal flotation parameters and equipment specifications. Our engineers can provide detailed equipment selection recommendations based on your specific requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What routine maintenance does a self-aspirated flotation cell require?",
      "answer": "Routine maintenance for self-aspirated flotation cells includes: periodic inspection of impellers and stators for wear (typically every 2-4 months); checking self-aspiration pipes for blockages; maintenance of motors and drive systems; lubrication and inspection of bearings and seals; cleaning and adjustment of scraper mechanisms; and calibration of control systems. It is recommended to establish a preventative maintenance schedule based on the abrasiveness of the processed ore and operational intensity to ensure long-term stable equipment operation."
