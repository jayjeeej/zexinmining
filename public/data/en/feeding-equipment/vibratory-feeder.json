    {
      "question": "How does a vibratory feeder work?",
      "answer": "The vibratory feeder uses dual motor-driven eccentric weights to produce directional vibration forces. When synchronized, these motors create specific vibration patterns that effectively convey material forward at controlled rates. Feed material enters the reinforced trough, which transforms vibration energy into material motion. As the entire trough assembly vibrates at frequencies of 960-1450 r/min with 4-6mm amplitude, material is propelled through a combination of vertical tossing action and horizontal advancement. This mechanical approach provides superior reliability when handling various materials while offering precise flow control through adjustable vibration parameters. The isolation system, consisting of heavy-duty springs or rubber mounts, contains vibration within the feeder assembly while preventing transmission to supporting structures."

    {
      "question": "How is the capacity of a vibratory feeder determined?",
      "answer": "Determining vibratory feeder capacity involves several key factors: 1) Trough width and length dimensions, defining the effective conveying surface; 2) Material characteristics including bulk density, particle size, and flowability; 3) Vibration parameters including frequency (typically 960-1450 r/min) and amplitude (4-6mm); 4) Trough inclination angle (horizontal or 10° inclined); 5) Material bed depth on the trough; 6) Material coefficient of friction; 7) Required conveying distance. Our engineering team uses specialized calculation methods incorporating these variables to determine appropriate feeder sizing for specific applications. For most materials, ZG Series feeders achieve capacity ranges from 30 t/h in smaller models to 1400 t/h in larger configurations, typically performing optimally at 70-80% of maximum rated capacity to accommodate feed variations."

      "question": "How does the dual motor drive system improve reliability?",
      "answer": "The dual motor drive system improves reliability through several mechanisms: 1) Synchronized counter-rotation creates a balanced force system, minimizing structural stress; 2) Elimination of complex mechanical drive components found in single-motor designs, such as eccentric shafts, bearings, and universal joints; 3) Redundancy allowing continued operation at reduced capacity even if one motor experiences problems; 4) Lower individual motor loads resulting in cooler operation and extended bearing life; 5) Simplified maintenance utilizing standard industrial motors rather than specialized components; 6) Better vibration control through precise force balancing; 7) Reduced power consumption through optimized energy transfer; 8) More even wear distribution on the trough structure; 9) Lower noise levels due to balanced operation; 10) Integrated thermal protection in each motor preventing damage from overheating. These advantages combine to provide industry-leading reliability ratings for properly maintained equipment, with mean time between failures (MTBF) exceeding 30,000 operating hours."

    },
    {
      "question": "How do amplitude and frequency affect feeder performance?",
      "answer": "Amplitude and frequency are the primary parameters controlling feeder performance: 1) Amplitude (typically 4-6mm in ZG Series) primarily determines the throwing action and therefore material velocity. Larger amplitude increases capacity but may cause excessive material bouncing and degradation. 2) Frequency (960-1450 r/min) affects how often the throwing action occurs. Higher frequency provides smoother flow but requires more power. 3) The combination of amplitude and frequency determines the 'G-force' applied to material, which must exceed material friction to initiate motion. 4) Larger amplitudes are generally better suited for coarse, heavy materials while higher frequencies work better for finer materials. 5) Proper selection depends on material characteristics, with adjustable systems providing flexibility for changing conditions. 6) Excessive amplitude can lead to structural fatigue and premature component failure. 7) ZG Series designs allow adjustment of both parameters after installation to optimize performance."
