  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How does a four-roll high voltage electrostatic separator work?",
      "answer": "The four-roll high voltage electrostatic separator operates based on the principle of different electrical conductivities among minerals. The system generates a high-voltage electric field between specialized electrodes and precision-engineered rotating rollers. As material passes through this field, conductive particles become charged and are either attracted to or repelled from the rollers depending on the field configuration. Non-conductive particles follow a different trajectory due to their inability to quickly transfer electrical charge. The four sequential rollers create multiple separation stages within a single machine, allowing for progressive refinement of the separation. Each roller can be individually adjusted for speed and field intensity, enabling optimization for different mineral characteristics and producing distinct streams of conductive and non-conductive products with high efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What advantages does a four-roll design offer compared to traditional electrostatic separators?",
      "answer": "The four-roll design provides several significant advantages: 1) Enhanced separation efficiency through multi-stage processing within a single unit; 2) Increased throughput capacity of up to 40% while maintaining high separation precision; 3) Improved flexibility with individually adjustable parameters for each roller; 4) Higher recovery rates for minerals with subtle conductivity differences; 5) Reduced floor space requirements compared to multiple single-roll units; 6) Lower energy consumption per ton of processed material; 7) Ability to perform different separation functions in sequence (roughing, cleaning, scavenging); 8) More consistent performance with feed variations due to the progressive separation approach. These benefits make four-roll separators particularly valuable for complex mineral processing applications requiring high precision and efficiency."

Proper maintenance ensures consistent separation performance and extends equipment life while maintaining safe operating conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does feed material preparation affect electrostatic separation efficiency?",
      "answer": "Feed preparation critically impacts separation efficiency through several factors: 1) Moisture content must be below 0.5% as excess moisture interferes with particle charging and electric field formation; 2) Particle size distribution should be controlled within 0.1-3mm for optimal separation; 3) Surface contamination, particularly oils or chemical residues, can alter conductivity properties and impair separation; 4) Material temperature affects conductivity and charge retention characteristics; 5) Consistent feed rate and even distribution across rollers is essential for stable performance; 6) Pre-classification of feed improves efficiency by presenting similarly sized particles to the electric field; 7) Dust removal prior to separation prevents field distortion and electrode fouling; 8) Proper drying and conditioning of materials enhances conductivity differences between minerals. Investing in appropriate feed preparation systems typically improves overall recovery and grade by 15-25%."
    },
    {
      "question": "What factors influence the selection of voltage settings?",
      "answer": "Voltage setting selection depends on multiple considerations: 1) Specific conductivity characteristics of target minerals being separated; 2) Particle size distribution - finer particles generally require higher field intensity; 3) Temperature and humidity of the processing environment; 4) Mineral liberation degree - complex intergrowths may require different settings than well-liberated particles; 5) Desired balance between recovery rate and concentrate grade; 6) Feed rate and bed thickness on the roller surface; 7) Distance between electrodes and roller surfaces; 8) Sequential processing considerations when using multiple rollers in series. Optimal voltage settings are typically determined through systematic testing of the specific material, beginning at lower settings (10-15kV) and gradually increasing while monitoring separation performance. Our technical team provides comprehensive material testing services to determine ideal voltage parameters for each application."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the DXJ series handle materials with variable conductivity properties?",
